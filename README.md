# Customer Segmentation and ML Application
This repository presents a customer segmentation project using K-means clustering, followed by the application of Machine Learning techniques to extract valuable insights from the segmented data.
## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics that involves dividing customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors, preferences, and characteristics. K-means clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm that helps identify natural clusters within the data. This project utilizes K-means to segment customers and then applies Machine Learning models on the segmented data to uncover meaningful patterns.
## Data
The dataset used in this project contains customer-related information, such as purchase history, demographics, and interactions. It is stored in the Customer-Segmentation-and-ML-Application/Online Retail.xlsx directory.
## Customize and Extend
Feel free to experiment with different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or machine learning models. Modify the code to suit your specific data and business requirements.
## Results
The project aims to provide actionable insights through customer segmentation, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer experiences, and boost overall performance.
